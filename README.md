# Embedded Computer Networks
These are the lab exercises and and lab sheets for the embedded computer networks module at Sheffield Hallam University.  

This academic year (2020-21) we are using the STM32F7 discovery boards for this module (http://www.st.com/en/evaluation-tools/32f746gdiscovery.html) and I have written some simple helper functions to help with some of the configuration stuff we are doing in the labs.

We will also be using the [SparkFun ESP8266 Arduino shields](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/esp8266-wifi-shield-hookup-guide/all) with the AT version 1.7 firmware.

All labs will now use the CMSIS-Driver architecture and the MDK-ARM pack structure.

*Note*: lab 103 is not yet updated for this academic year - it needs updating to use the CMSIS-RTOS2 API - rather than version 1 as it is at present.
